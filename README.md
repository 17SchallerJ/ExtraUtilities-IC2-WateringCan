This is a mod I threw together to make a version of the extra utilities watering can that works on IC2 crops.

Is also able to modify the stats of the crop as well. Growth, Gain, Resistance, Nutrients, Hyrdation and WeedEx.

Almost everything is configurable from the mod options menu or config file.
The included config is the default.

Note on the stat modifications (Growth, Gain, Resistance): The stats only roll to see if they will increment on a successfull tick roll.

IE. the default tick chance is .3 (30%) and the default skill increment chance is .025 (2.5%) so there is a 0.0075 (0.75%) chance per tick a skill will increment.
